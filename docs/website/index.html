<p>
	Minerva is a robust Comet server and client.  You can use it to
	build web applications that need a socket-like abstraction.  Your application
	simply needs to send and receive strings.  The Minerva server is built
	on top of <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a>.  The JavaScript
	client uses <a href="https://code.google.com/closure/library/">Closure Library</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Some uses for Minerva: chat applications, games, real-time collaboration, dashboards, monitoring systems.

<h2 id="h-highlights">Highlights</h2>

<ul>

<li>	Reliable and in-order message delivery: Both client and server attach
		sequence numbers to messages and send/receive ACKs.  Messages never get lost or
		re-ordered, even when the HTTP transports are used.

<li>	Serialization-agnostic: Your application isn't forced to use JSON, XML, or
		anything else.

<li>	Cross-browser: Minerva works in old and new versions of IE, Firefox, Chrome,
		Safari, and Opera.  Minerva disables the page-loading spinner in all browsers.

<li>	Multiple transports: Minerva runs over HTTP <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling">long-polling</a>, HTTP streaming, and
		Flash sockets.  Its design easily supports new transports.

<li>	Robust timeout logic: Stuck requests and sockets are detected and aborted.

<li>	Handles tab addicts: To work around browsers' per-domain active
		request limits (usually just 4-6 requests), Minerva can send HTTP
		requests to random subdomains.  Your web application will work as
		usual when you open it in a dozen tabs.  If you want to use this on
		your HTTPS site, a wildcard cert is required.

<h2 id="h-disclaimers">Disclaimers</h2>

<p>
	Go ahead and try out Minerva because it should work well, but keep in mind that
	right now:
</p>

<ul>

<li>	The API isn't stable yet.  It will be soon, after some initial feedback.

<li>	There's no cross-domain support yet.  Right now, website.com can
		only connect to a Minerva server at *.website.com.  If you really want cross-domain
		support, you can use Closure Library's cross-domain support (goog.net.xpc)
		combined with the Minerva client in an iframe.

<li>	If you don't want to use Twisted or Closure Library, you'll have to do some
		legwork.  We'll soon have better support for non-Twisted and non-Closure
		Library users.

<li>	Despite HTTP streaming and Flash sockets working, there's no automatic
		negotiation between HTTP long-polling/HTTP streaming/Flash sockets yet.  For
		Internet-facing applications, use just long-polling for now.

</ul>



<h2 id="h-faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3>What about <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/WebSockets">WebSocket</a>?</h3>

<p>
Minerva's HTTP transport (which uses XHR on the client) means that if a user can load your website, they
can also connect to your Minerva server, as long as they have JavaScript enabled.
This isn't the case with WebSocket, because (1) browser support is still poor
(2) even in browsers that support it, many networks make WebSocket connections
impossible.  Google <a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg05593.html">reported success rates</a> of
67% (port 80) to 95% (port 443).
</p>

<p>
As far as we can tell, there's no good reason to implement a Minerva transport
that uses WebSocket.  Your web application can just use Minerva as a fallback
for when a WebSocket connection fails.  Alternatively, it can use Minerva as
the initial connection method, for potentially faster connection setup.
We'll soon document some ways to use both Minerva and WebSocket.
</p>

<p>
Note that WebSocket is vastly superior to HTTP transports in this use case: sending small
messages frequently from the client to the server.  If you use HTTP transports
for this, the client wastes bandwidth by sending the same HTTP headers
for every message.  But for most applications, Comet-style HTTP transports work fine.
</p>

<h3>Do I need to use Twisted?</h3>

<p>
For now, yes.  In the future, we might have an TCP gateway and a WebSocket gateway.
These will allow you to use Minerva's reliable HTTP transports without writing
any Python/Twisted server code; you will just specify a TCP/WebSocket server
for Minerva to proxy to.
</p>

<h3>How many simultaneous connections can the server handle?</h3>

<p>
Somewhere around 10,000-20,000 per Minerva server.  If you run your own
benchmarks, remember to: (1) select the best Twisted reactor for your OS
(epoll on Linux) (2) think about TIME_WAIT sockets: they might clog up
your benchmark (3) try PyPy.
</p>

<p>Why not 100,000 or more?  Minerva was built for correctness, not for
maximizing connection count.  There are three mitigating factors:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can run a Minerva server for every CPU you have.

<li>Minerva works on <a href="http://pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, and it'll keep getting faster.

<li>WebSocket will soon work for more users, and you can bypass
	Minerva entirely for your WebSocket connections.
</ol>

<h3>The client uses Closure Library.  Does this use Google's BrowserChannel?</h3>

<p>
No, but the Minerva protocol does solve the same problems as BrowserChannel.
</p>

<h3>Minerva's <code>HttpFace</code> uses twisted.web.  Should I expose
twisted.web to the Internet?</h3>

<p>
twisted.web generally works well, but you probably don't want to expose it
to the Internet (though many do).  Consider putting it behind nginx (or similar)
for three reasons:
<ol>
	<li>nginx has better support for unusual/old/broken HTTP clients.

	<li>nginx has better HTTPS support: SSL sessions are cached, and
		compatibility options are enabled.

	<li>nginx is a lot harder to DoS than twisted.web.
</ol>
</p>

<h3>I'd like to read the code.  Where do I start?</h3>

<p>
The guts of the server are implemented in <a href="https://github.com/ludios/Minerva/blob/master/minerva/mserver.py">mserver.py</a> and the client in <a href="https://github.com/ludios/Minerva/blob/master/js_minerva/cw/net/client.js">client.js</a>.  Consider reading it in <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IDEA</a> so that can jump to function definitions quickly.  Your understanding may be assisted by <a href="data_flow.png">a sketch of how Minerva works</a>, the <a href="protocol.htm">frame types used by the Minerva protocol</a>, and by playing with <code>/chatapp/?mode=http</code> on the <code>minerva_site</code> server.  Understanding the separation between the stream and the transports is critical.  You're welcome to ask questions about how Minerva works, or why it works a certain way.
</p>

<h3>Why are Minerva strings restricted to 95 codepoints (" " 0x20 to "~" 0x7E)?</h3>

<p>
This design decision simplifies Minerva and helps keep the API stable if new
transports are added in the future.  The codepoint range doesn't seriously
impact most applications: you can use JSON (encoded as ASCII-only), or Base64,
or even <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Ascii85">higher Base*</a>
encodings.  This decision is left to you.
</p>

<p>
Supporting more than this codepoint range would make Minerva more fragile to
changes in the transports it uses.  For example, XMLHttpRequest can't receive
0x00 in IE and Opera.  XMLHttpRequest's readyState 3 and Unicode often don't
mix (especially in older Firefox versions).  XDomainRequest (IE8+) replaces a
large number of non-Character Unicode codepoints.
