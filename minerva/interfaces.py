	An interface for string-based communication that abstracts
	away the Comet logic and transports.

	This interface is analogous to L{twisted.internet.interfaces.IProtocol}

	Note: if you call stream.reset, some (or all) of the strings you
	have recently sent may be lost.  If you need a proper close, use
	your own application-level strings to determine that it is safe to
	close, then call reset.

	The simplest way to end dead ServerStreams is to use an application-level
	ping message that your client application sends (say every 55 seconds),
	and end the ServerStream if no such message has been received for
	2 minutes.

		This is `stringsReceived` instead of `stringReceived` only as an

		called with a certain number of strings.
